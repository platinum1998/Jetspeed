# Jetspeed
Jetspeed is a game developed by Yello Games for one of there clients. We was given the task to re-develop Jetspeed in Babylon.

Jetspeed is a endless runner style of game. 
You control a spaceship and fly through this sci-fi environment filled with tall towers and large obstructions that you must avoid. 
You can go through rings along the way that will give you a boost in score by 100. If you reach the end you go through a large black hole,
and transport into an unknown universe.
